# Text Analysis Code README

## Overview
This Python code is designed to perform text analysis on blog posts retrieved from specified URLs. The analysis includes sentiment analysis, readability metrics, and other linguistic features. The main functionalities of the code include:

1. Retrieving blog post content from given URLs.
2. Saving the content to text files for further processing.
3. Analyzing the text files to extract various linguistic features.
4. Updating an Excel file with the analysis results.

## Required Packages
To run this code, you need to have the following packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `nltk`
- `transformers`
- `textstat`

You can install these packages via pip with the following command:
```
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests nltk transformers textstat
```

Additionally, you need to download the NLTK data for tokenization. You can do this by running the following Python code before executing the main script:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## How to Run the Code
I prefer to run the code on Google Colab for better compatibility and ease of use. However, you can also run it on your local machine.
1. Ensure all required packages are installed as mentioned above.
2. Download the provided code script and the Excel file named `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.
3. Modify the path to the Excel file in the code if necessary.
4. Execute the code. Upon execution, the code will perform the following steps:
   - Retrieve content from the URLs specified in the Excel file.
   - Save the content to text files in a folder named `blog_text`.
   - Analyze the text files to extract linguistic features.
   - Update the Excel file with the analysis results, creating a new Excel file named `final.xlsx`.
